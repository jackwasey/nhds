#' National Hospital Discharge Survey 2010 data
#'
#' This is public domain data from the US [Center for Disease
#' Control](https://www.cdc.gov). This is deidentified patient data describing
#' the information at the end of a hospital admission, including demographic
#' information, admission diagnoses, comorbidities and procedure codes, death or
#' disposition. There are no identifiers in the data, so an integer count was
#' included in this data for this purpose.
