This is a new release, resubmitted after addressing CRAN's comments on the DESCRIPTION content, requesting more detail and a reference, and adding angular brackets around URL in DESCRIPTION. 'They 'nhds' previously had a dependency on a simultaneous submission for package 'icd', but the current submission no longer requires a particular version of 'icd.'

This is a new release.
