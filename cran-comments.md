I am submitting icd 3.4, icd.data 1.1 and a new pacakge nhds 1.0 simultaneously. They previously had interdependencies, but the current submission makes appropriate accommodations for different package versions.

This is a new release.

## Test environments
* MacOS Mojave, R 3.5.2
* Ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.5.2
* Ubuntu 18.10, R 3.5.2, clang 7.0

## R CMD check results
